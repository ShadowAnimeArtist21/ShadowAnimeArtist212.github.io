    <p>3. SSC TUATARA : 283 MPH</p>
</h2>
<h3>
    <p>
        Next in our list of top 10 fastest cars in the world is  SSC Tuatara.<br>
         This car made big news in 2020 when they announced that theyâ€™ll reach the top speed of 331 MPH.<br>
          However after the actual ground testing they had to go back on their word as they admitted that<br>
           the car never crossed the 310 mph mark. Apart from this their is also a light version of this car<br>
          called SSC Ultimate Aero which has attained the speed of 283 MPH which is quite impressive.

    <p>1. BUGATTI CHIRON SUPER SPORT 300+ : 304 MPH</p>
</h2>
<h3>
    <p>
       First in a list of top 10 fastest cars in the world is again from Bugatti.<br>
      Bugatti chiron super sport has been one of the fastest cars in the world for a long period of time.<br>
       Call was the first to break the 300 + mph record and can  still do so. <br>
        This car is a level up version of the original Bugatti  Chiron and beats the older version<br>
         in speed and agility. The top speed is yet to be determined of this car but it is safe<br>
          to assume that it will easily cross the 300 mph mark.
